# Chapter 8 - Aram - Year 80

- Aram exclaims that he completely forgot about the break-ins and how he had never figured out what happened. He tells Zubber about all the different cases he was reporting on and how Costram was his best friend but never mentioned his ties with the Mystics and Splints. He still wonders what role it played.
He says the only common thread he found was that it happened to people of a certain prestige.
- "Splints?" Oh thats one of the groups that split off the Mystics after the Sabotage. It was a turning point for the movement and its relationship with the rest of the society. "We should look at what Astral did with the sabotage to see what really happened".
