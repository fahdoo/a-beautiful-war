# Chapter 10 - Aram - Present

- The explosion must have been a huge setback on the Sifr Rocket? It could have been worse. The explosives weren't the best quality and while they did a lot of damage the team had some prototypes that they ended up salvaging for the final rocket. It took them some time to build a new office and restore their systems/computers since Astral had placed explosives there as well. But they had backups of all the data.
- I remember Mara being very distraught. It was a tough time for her to see her father almost die, even if they weren't that close. I think thats what caused her to take part in the mission. What mission? She was one of the people selected to be on the Sifr Rocket. How did the selections happen. I recall Alma and Mazar having a whole selection process that resulted in a team selected for a several year training program. I applied myself but didn't get selected. I wanted to go up with Mara.
- So we should look at Mara says Zash. Aram says he isn't ready for that. I think there are a few threads we can explore. Mazar and Alma for the selection and what Costram and Phea ended up doing after the Mystics broke off.
