# Chapter 9 - Astral - Year 10

- The early morning of the Protest, Astral is talking with his "crew". They're waiting for Costram
- Costram shows up with the card and before he gives it, just asks if anyone will get hurt. Astral tells him there are different levels of hurt and he has to choose what he finds acceptable. That if the Protest is successful at achieving its aims, the Sabotage will be safe.
- Astral shares some final words with his team and then they split off. Astral and Costram go to meet Alal, Anda, Phea and the rest. They've gathered in front of More Inc and hoping that more people will show up. They've been very active the last several months and its this moment that will show how successful they've been.
- Alal gives some inspiring words as the sun starts to rise.
- The More Inc security approaches them and starts threatening them and calls for back up.
- Slowly hundreds of people start to show up. Soon its thousands.
- At the same time More Inc employees start showing up and they can't get through. The extra security shows up as well. They await orders.
- Costram sees his father show up but there's a lot of people in the crowd that he blends in
- There is a standoff the whole day, the employees are sent back for their safety. As the sun beings to set Astral splits off from the crowd and goes to a loading dock area and uses Cacoph's card to open it. His crew enters with some equipment. 
- Astral heads towards Cacoph's office. He goes there and copies the information from the computer. 
- Astral's team heads towards where the Sifr Rocket is being built and plant some devices/bombs
- The Protest is happening there is increasing tension. The security force and the protesters are exchanging harsh words. 
- Mazar shows up, really pissed off. He calls on Alal to meet with him. They both go inside to talk. They talk about what this is about and if theres any resolution. They both have very different points of view.
- An explosion happens inside. Everyone is stunned. The security agents start using force, shoot water, rubber bullets, gas canisters towards the crowd.
- Mazar is severely injured but survives. Alal dies.
- The protesters disperse.
- Anda and Phea realize that Astral is missing and they are suspicious.
- They meet back at their meeting place and confront Astral. Astral says its the time for a new movement. Phea doesn't agree and leaves. Astral claims she was a spy all along and didn't understand why the old man trusted her, but Phea says she is truer to Alal's intentions. Phea looks at Costram and says "I thought you would have been a better person".
