# Chapter 13 - Phea - Year 10

- Phea is being questioned in regards to the Sabotage and her knowledge of it. They had reviewed Alal's memories. They know she is part of the Mystics and her role in the Protest. They don't want to publicly announce her involvement but the others would be brought in and questioned till they find Astral (he's blacked out). 
- Pastel comes in and they have a big argument and he's upset that such a big part of her life has been a secret.
- They let her go. Phea goes to meet Mara. Phea is about to tell Mara about her role with Alal but Mara is so upset about her father that Phea keeps quite.
- She goes to see Anda and tells her and they discuss their questionings and about Astral. They talk about how they can't let Alal's message die. This is the beginning of the Spirits.
