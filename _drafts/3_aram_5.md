# Chapter 3 - Aram (Year 5)

- First day at the Grand Central Academy, Aram is with his friend Costram. They feel excited yet nervous. Aram talks about how he doesn't really want to be there because he just wants to write and has this freelance position as a reporter.
- Inside the Auditorium for Initiation, Aram notices Mara. It was the first time he saw her since the Proximity. He tells Costram "thats Her." Costram naturally makes fun of him. Mara makes eye contact, and smiles as before. "She remembers me!" exclaims Aram.
- After the Initiation, Mara and Phea come up to Aram and Costram. 
- Inside Aram's classroom, their Teacher, Cherin, tells them that the Teacher, Themea, listed on their schedules is no longer available.
- Aram reads an article about the Vanishings and wondered if his missing Teacher was part of it. He thinks about sneaking into the Teacher's Office to find more. Mara see's him and wants to help out. They both sneak in and try to find records. They find the house address of the Teacher and decide to skip class the next day to go to that address. They find nothing there.
