# Chapter 6 - Alal - Year 5

- Alal is holding a meeting on a hill top. There's about 50 people there. In the crowd are Astral, Anda (and her baby Alea), Costram and Phea.
- Alal talks about nature and bonds. About the push and pull between the two planets. The complete destruction of Aique and the pristine serenity of Sifr. That they would only do the same to it as they had to their own planet.
- Alal reveals that he is in communication with the planet Sifr and that unless they invited us we shouldn't go.
- Certain members of the crowd suggested aggressive action. Alal wanted to work with ideas and change through minds. He opposed force to prevent the space launch. They had several years. He suggested they spread their message through local meetings and build a strong enough public opposition that the Metastation will have no other choice.
- Phea comes up to Alal afterwards. She says, you do know whose daughter I am? He says he is aware, and that she wouldn't have come if she had the wrong intentions, and that he doesn't have anything to hide, as all he has are words that he wants everyone to hear.
- Astral approaches Costram and indicates he disagrees with the pacifist approach and if Costram feels the same way. He asks about his father, Cacoph. Costram says he's not his father. Astral suggests they could help each other out someday.
