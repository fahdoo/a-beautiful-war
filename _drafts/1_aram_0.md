# Chapter 1 - Aram - Cycle 0

What does one think of when their eyes look back on themselves? For Aram it was a ritual of great discomfort to look at himself in the mirror every morning. All his doubts pierced through him while he made sure the world was unaware as long as he was presentable. Presentable enough. Face washed, hair combed, teeth brushed, shirt tucked in and the tie, well, that he needed help with. Numerous attempts of loops and knots resulted in an awkward asymmetric fashion that were not in fashion, now or possibly ever. Asking his brother Arcan was out of the question; he might end up getting choked. His father Apart would get upset that he hadn't learned how to tie a knot by now. Alma, his mother, had left hours ago - it was the most important day of her life. Aram knew she wouldn't have been any help either. She saves the world every day; the Tie Crisis would not figure high on her list of priorities. He folded the tie, untidily as kids do, and placed it in the pockets of his pants.

The eyes still stared back every time he looked, through a cloud of haze. There was something thrilling to Aram about knowing that he was reflecting on himself, literally and figuratively. He carefully observed the pattern of dots and colors beneath his eyes that wrapped his nose and cheek like a freckled mask. He squinted to notice the details. The patterns formed a unique mark of his identity and recognition of his Culture. The cloudy white and morning sky blue dots and swirls seem elegantly and intentionally placed but are nothing more than the same as why each hair on his head are placed where they are.

"Ouch!" Aram quickly turned around, knowing who to expect. "Arcan, why did you have to punch me?". He grabbed his left shoulder and rubbed it knowing it would be a constant reminder for the next few days.

"Quit staring at your ugly face and come down already. The motorcade is waiting and Dad's going to flip out if we miss Mom's speech, and worse, the start of the Festival of Proximity. You know dad likes his Synchronized Cycle Dancers." Arcan informed before noticing, "And where's your tie?" 

"Nevermind that, I'll be just a minute."

"Well if your not wearing it then neither am I, its too hot for this", he said as he walked down the staircase, stripping off the tie and tossing it in the air.

Aram put on his glasses, went to his room, and opened the drawer besides his desk and picked out a small black pocket book. Slightly worn, with soft leather dimples, the fresh scent of new pages now barely perceptible. He reached further inside for his favorite pen, the More Ink 0.5mm. Light to the touch and rolled deep dark lines with silken ease - and never smudged. He took both and placed them in his pocket only to find them rebel and pop out onto the floor. 

"Huh? Oh, the tie. The damn tie! Well at least someone was smart enough to invent another pocket."

With his journal and pen in the tieless pocket of his pants, Aram was ready. At least to the best of his intentions.

"Why don't we get to ride in this everyday!" exclaimed Arcan as the black sedan with tinted windows took them towards the Grand Central Forum. "If I arrived at the Academy in this machine with a driver, with the support of armed vehicles as well, people would know who I am."

"Special occasions only Arcan. Your education is not a special occasion," dryly replied Apart while reading the latest news. "At least not with your performance", he just couldn't resist to add while he turned around to look back at him.

Arcan rolled his eyes and looked out the window before replying "they just don't value my talents." He then peeked at this younger brother scribbling in his little journal. "This one will do well though, they love kids that bury themselves in books."

Aram ignored this amateurish taunt. He knew better by now. He quietly captured the world as he saw it in his journal, writing down the stories he could and couldn't see. 

The motorcade left their compound located at the prestigious Outerring, headed on to the Peraxis bridge that leapt for several miles over the Middlering. The bridge was a remarkable achievement, towering over the population as if it passed over an ocean. It saved countless hours of time as people headed towards the central core of Proxacity, the International City of the Cultures.

Aram stopped writing and stared down onto the infinite walls and endless roads that passed beneath. The colors of the roofs blended together into a grayish sludge. Occasionally, he felt he made eye contact with someone for a split second. An old lady who peeped through a hole in the wall or a child who played on the streets? Perhaps. Aram wondered how many people lived in the Middlering and what stories they must hold in themselves.

***

It was apparent they neared Proxacity when the colors changed from dull gray to bright pastels, concrete gave way to stones, and silent attentiveness turned into comfortable relaxation. 

The motorcade snaked its way through the crowded narrow streets that barely separated skyscrapers. The afternoon sun itself would seep through in the thinnest possible sheets of light.

"Are we there yet?" impatiently asked Arcan. Apart turned to the driver, who remained expressionless. "When you see the light again we will be there," replied Apart.

Sure enough, the buildings cleared, and a great circle of green pastures remained nestled in the midst, unto which the sun showered its warmth with selfless grace. On one side were the buildings, forming an arc around the greenery, and and the other side was the seemingly endless water of Oceania.

"Garden of Decisions," wrote Aram in his notebook, "not because any decision are made here, but as it is connected by a beautiful walkway to the Great Hall of Stationary Decisions. Calling it the Garden of the Great Hall of Stationary Decisions would not have been the most eloquent of labels, and hence, it is known as the Garden of Decisions." Aram looked out his window, and noticed the garden was moving. He squinted.

"Look at all those people!" Arcan excitedly got out of his seat and moved on to Aram's side, knocking his journal to the floor. "There must be a billion people, right dad!"

"Math really isn't your strongest subject Arcan. But yes, all those people, soon you won't see any of the grass! The news estimates there will be a few million people here today for the Festival," Apart nodded while pointing towards the snippet of news on his hands.

Aram quietly picked up his journal. A few pages had creased, which led to an unresolvable disappointment within him.

***

The motorcade stopped and the door was opened by a young woman in uniform. She poked her head inside and smiled at Aram. "Hey I'm Opira. Are you boys ready? Don't let any of this overwhelm you." Opira then glanced towards Apart, "Good afternoon Sir, we'll take you all to the special viewing area for the ceremonies now."

Aram interjected quickly, "can't we go see our Mom before?" 

"Yes, it would be nice if we could," Apart inquired towards Opira.

Opira whispered briefly to someone outside before saying "Sure, we have some time!"

The four of them hopped onto a small motorized cart, that took one of the paths that was cordoned off from the crowds. The closer they get to the center of the Garden of Decisions, the louder it got. At the center of the garden was a grandiose monument to celebrate the Proximity between the two planets, Aique and Sifr. It appears as if two giant mounds kissed each other, one rising from the ground itself and the other mysteriously floating in the air and almost transparent due to its mesh construction.

"This must be the first Proximity for both of you," stated Opira before continuing and pointing towards the monument, "the space between the monuments two slivers of spheres represent the Proximity and make for a giant stage. Station Alma, your Mom, is inside the ground sphere that represents our amazing planet Aique. You'll get to see the inside of the spheres today; in fact very few people on Aique get to experience this!" she said cheerfully while Aram dutifully noted down here explanations.

They entered through a guarded door at the base of the ground sphere and were led through several corridors with guarded entrances before entering this vast hall that lay hidden from the outside. 

Aram noticed that people were dressed impeccably, holding drinks and grabbing appetizers from trays carried by people dressed equally well. Aram's hands instinctively	 went towards his pocket. His tie was still there, but this wasn't the right time to attempt to put it on.

Opira led them to an enclave. "Station Alma, you have some visitors!" she announced with a smile.

Alma turned to Opira and gave her a stern stare, in response to interrupting the seemingly important conversation she was having with a man dressed quite differently from the rest of the guests, but in a way that set him above them without being overbearingly obvious.

"Alma my dear," Apart walked forward to avoid any unnecessary disciplining of the helpful young lady. Alma returned her contorted face to normal, "Ah, Apart, I'm glad you and the kids made it in the time. Let me have a look at them." Arcan and Aram stepped forward in sync besides their father, standing up straight as possible without making eye contact. Alma shook her head, "where are the ties we got for you two?" she said in such a quiet manner it seemed to pierce through the ears of everyone around.

Aram's hand squeezed his right pocket. This was also not the right time.

"Won't you introduce me to your family, Station Alma?" interjected the uniquely dressed man, hoping to avoid an incidence of infanticide in front of a crowd of very well connected people.

"You've met Apart" - "Why yes good to see you again" - "And my two boys Arcan and Aram, who seem to be blissfully unaware of the significance of a person's first Proximity."

The man kneeled down, eye to eye with Aram and placed his hand on Arcan's shoulder. "Well, I'm sure these young men will appreciate it by the end of the night." He quickly sprang up and struck a big smile towards Alma, "And what's a little fashion faux pas but the next Cycle's most popular trend. In fact, I will join them so they don't feel out of place." With that he took off his stringy thin tie and placed it in his right pocket, completely indifferent to Alma's shocked face which led Apart to burst out laughing. "Oh Mazar", Apart said pausing to laugh again, "if there's one day you can get away with that its today."

This exchange was on the precipice of turning into a thoroughly awkward conversation, when a woman approach from behind Mazar. Her offset style and the matching Culture pattern under her eyes suggested to Aram that she was his wife. "Come Mazar, we should leave Alma alone, she must need to prepare for her speech."

"Well, before I overextend my welcome, I'll take my wife and girls to the viewing area," Mazar said while he simultaneously looked around "where _are_ the girls Merida?" 

As if on cue, a young officer, in the same uniform as Opira came holding two girls, one in each hand. "Sir, I'm sorry, but these are yours I believe?" 

Mazar sighed, looked at the girls pretending to be innocent, and smiled, "why yes, I do believe they belong to us. And I believe there is a good story to go along with them."

The young man hesitated to say as he let the girls go, but noticed Alma's inquisitive look, "these girls were caught trying to go up to Sifr."

"Sifr!?", almost everyone but Aram said in shock, which almost threw the young officer off-balance. He stuttered, "the monument ... the sphere ... not the planet, of course."

Alma dismissed him with a gesture and sternly looked towards Mazar, "I hope you will have a better handle on your company than your daughters."

Mazar gave an unseemly nervous laughter, "there must have been some misunderstanding, I'm sure they just wanted some ... fresh air?"

"Why is he wearing slippers?!", exclaimed the youngest one that belonged to Mazar and Merida, while pointing a straight edged finger that seemed to end at Aram's feet. Aram thought that was strange and so he naturally, like the rest of them, looked down. 

"Oh," was all Aram could really say at that moment. 

"Kid you are going to get it now!" said Arcan with much joy while a spattering of laughter came from the others except for Alma.

Aram looked at the girl with the finger, who gave him a sly smile. He wanted to be mad at her for breaking an unspoken, unagreed upon bond between children that only existed in Aram's mind. But he couldn't help but smile back at her. Because he appreciated how observant she was and how she had masterfully turned the attention from her and her sister's security breach to his absent-minded fashion.

"This is exactly what I don't need at this moment," Alma said sternly and directly to no one in particular. "Thank you for coming to see me, but I need some time to prepare about the biggest moment of my life, and not this boy's...", Alma trailed off, shaking her head, and motioning towards Opira. "Take them to their spots, I will see them after the Ceremony is complete."

Mazar took this as sign for a similar exist, "we'll have to continue our discussion some other time Station Alma, I'm glad you have trusted in me and More Inc to help deliver your ambitious plans for the next Cycle."

***

"Dad, why do they keep calling Mom 'Station Alma'?", inquired Arcan as they were led by Opira to their reserved spot in the viewing section. This question seemed to upset Apart, "have you not been paying any attention to what we've been discussing at home for the last little while? Its also kind of what everyone in the news has been reporting on."

Aram thought it was an appropriate time to show up his brother. "Mom's an important person now, so they call say 'Station'", as he looked towards his father for approval.

"Yes. Well.", Apart formulated his thoughts, "she has been elected by the previous Stations to the position of the Station of Defense for this upcoming Cycle. That is why she is important. She gets to protect us."

"Who does she get to blow up?", Arcan asked excitedly.

"No one! It's not a Station of Offense Arcan!", Apart raised his hands in frustration. "It was a position instated several Cycles ago when all the Cultures ended their war with each other. The Station of Defense works on things that will prevent us from blowing each other up."

"The last Station of Defense is the new Metastation Pastel, right dad?", Aram added having saved this morsel of information from a newscast he consumed just a few days ago.

"Yes, he'll be speaking last, after all the other Stations", replied Apart as they neared their seats.

As they sat down, Aram took a look behind them. It was true, he could not see any grass anywhere, just eyes staring up towards him. He squinted. He wondered if the girl was looking back at him. He was sure she was, and so he smiled.

***

The ceremonies began with the Station of Sifr, who introduced himself as Alal, an elder. Aram had not read much about him but wrote down what he could understand.

Alal spoke: "I have spent my life in reverence to Sifr and our relationship with this distant gem that chooses to visit us every generation. It is a kiss that is never made, but tantalizes with its...proximity." A word which had gravity for the crowd and led to chants of the word in smatterings throughout the millions that were standing there in the Garden of Decisions. Alal continued, "the Cycle of our two planets, Aique and Sifr, are a reminder that what actions we take will come back around to us. That we may change from one generation to another but remain simply the same. The beauty we see reflected in its bright light is an ideal we can strive towards, each Cycle, however many Cycles it may take."

"This is so boring!", Arcan said only loud enough for his father and brother to hear. He tilted his head up to the sky, soaking in the warmth of the sun, "when are we going to see the Fireshakers and Soundjammers?". "After sunset Arcan, now keep quite and listen," Apart impatiently responded.

Several other Stations came up to speak their turn, thanking their previous counterparts and showing gratitude for being selected for this prestigious and powerful rank.

The Station of Defense, Alma, was finally up next. Arcan and Aram perked up, excited to see their mother up in front of the countless population. The significance of this moment only now hit Aram. He realized that their family and his life would be very different after this point. It probably wouldn't be better in his mind, and they weren't starting at a high point to begin with. Still, Aram felt he had to honor this moment for the prestige of their family. And he took out his tie and wrapped it around his little neck making several knots that had no real purpose.

Alma confidently walked onto the spherical stage that represented Planet Aique, but had a moment where she seemed to have been overwhelmed. Only Aram seemed to have noticed. It was not due to the millions of people in the crowd, but the sphere of the representation of Planet Sifr hanging right above her. It was an intricate mesh of glass, that would seem to capture the entirety of the crowd and place them everywhere above and around Alma. She closed her eyes for a second and stepped up towards the podium.

"People of all Cultures, I stand before you today because together we decided a few Cycles ago that we would rather live together in one world than apart in separated enclaves." She paused, thinking of adding a caveat, but refrained. "I fought in those battles and it saddens me that we had to hurt each other to learn how to love one another. As your newly elected Station of Defense, I hope our love will stay bonded like the two orbits of Aique and Sifr, and we can protect ourselves from our pasts."

"And we must look towards the future to learn how to preserve our heritage. The problems we face are quite grave. Our wonderful planet cannot sustain all of our people at the rate we are consuming it. But I am not here to tell you what you and cannot have. I am here to make a promise to you. Our world's resource problems will be solved creating a safe and plentiful future for many more Cycles of generations. At the next Proximity I promise we will send our best scientists and researchers on an exploratory mission to the Planet Sifr. We are calling it the Sifrocket."

Alma stopped here. It was not written on her speech for her to pause but her natural instincts as an orator led her to this conclusion, validated by the immediate thrilling shrieks and excited stupor of the vast many people from all the Cultures around the world. Here to witness the Proximity, but now witnessing more than a giant rock in the sky, but a vision for the future.

Aram felt proud. This was what she had been working so hard to put together. Why she had not been home most days. He felt it was a worthwhile sacrifice, but one that would continue. It created a tinge of sadness in him. He had to grow up. He was a grown up already, but now he had no choice.

The acoustics of the stage reverberated the crowd's voice perfectly. It also made Alma notice that pockets of disgruntled voices. It was no surprise that there would be people that would oppose this plan. In fact, she avoided eye contact with the Stations already sitting on stage as she knew there was one amongst them who cared the most to oppose this plan.

"This mission will be the most significant event in our history. It will be looked upon as a turning point by future generations, and you wile a part of it. The Sifrocket will be a project that this administration will give highest priority to," Alma said with conviction. "I now have the esteemed honor of inviting on stage your newly elected Metastation Pastel!"

_The new Metastation, Pastel, delivers the final speech and announces the successful deployment of the Sky Mesh, which at the nights viewing will light up the skies. He talks about the unifying of all Cultures and having the Sky Mesh be a reminder for all the Cultures to live in peace and harmony; and to protect themselves from a repeat of past conflicts with the Isolates._

***

_With that the festivities begin. There are fireworks and music and dances and performances. Aram is mesmerized by the energy yet he can't stop thinking about Mara. Sifr shines a pearl blue with spots of green, reminded him of her eyes. As night falls green streaks appear in the sky - the Sky Mesh has been turned on._

_Apart takes his kids to their motorcade and as Aram is getting in, he sees Mara in the distance, who gives him a smile as she gets in her own car._
