# Chapter 1 - Aram - Cycle 0

What does one think of when their eyes look back on themselves? For Aram it was a ritual of great discomfort to look at himself in the mirror every morning. All his doubts pierced through him while he made sure the world was unaware as long as he was presentable. Presentable enough. Face washed, hair combed, teeth brushed, shirt tucked in and the tie, well, that he needed help with. Numerous attempts of loops and knots resulted in an awkward asymmetric fashion that were not in fashion, now or possibly ever. Asking his brother Arcan was out of the question; he might end up getting choked. His father Apart would get upset that he hadn't learned how to tie a knot by now. Alma, his mother, had left hours ago - it was the most important day of her life. Aram knew she wouldn't have been any help either. She saves the world every day; the Tie Crisis would not figure high on her list of priorities. He folded the tie, untidily as kids do, and placed it in the pockets of his pants.

The eyes still stared back every time he looked, through a cloud of haze. There was something thrilling to Aram about knowing that he was reflecting on himself, literally and figuratively. He carefully observed the pattern of dots and colors beneath his eyes that wrapped his nose and cheek like a freckled mask. He squinted to notice the details. The patterns formed a unique mark of his identity and recognition of his Culture. The cloudy white and morning sky blue dots and swirls seem elegantly and intentionally placed but are nothing more than the same as why each hair on his head are placed where they are.

"Ouch!" Aram quickly turned around, knowing who to expect. "Arcan, why did you have to punch me?". He grabbed his left shoulder and rubbed it knowing it would be a constant reminder for the next few days.

"Quit staring at your ugly face and come down already. The motorcade is waiting and Dad's going to flip out if we miss Mom's speech, and worse, the start of the Festival of Proximity. You know dad likes his Synchronized Cycle Dancers." Arcan informed before noticing, "And where's your tie?" 

"Nevermind that, I'll be just a minute."

"Well if your not wearing it then neither am I, its too hot for this", he said as he walked down the staircase, stripping off the tie and tossing it in the air.

Aram put on his glasses, went to his room, and opened the drawer besides his desk and picked out a small black pocket book. Slightly worn, with soft leather dimples, the fresh scent of new pages now barely perceptible. He reached further inside for his favorite pen, the More Ink 0.5mm. Light to the touch and rolled deep dark lines with silken ease - and never smudged. He took both and placed them in his pocket only to find them rebel and pop out onto the floor. 

"Huh? Oh, the tie. The damn tie! Well at least someone was smart enough to invent another pocket."

With his journal and pen in the tieless pocket of his pants, Aram was ready. At least to the best of his intentions.

"Why don't we get to ride in this everyday!" exclaimed Arcan as the black sedan with tinted windows took them towards the Grand Central Forum. "If I arrived at the Academy in this machine with a driver, with the support of armed vehicles as well, people would know who I am."

"Special occasions only Arcan. Your education is not a special occasion," dryly replied Apart while reading the latest news. "At least not with your performance", he just couldn't resist to add while he turned around to look back at him.

Arcan rolled his eyes and looked out the window before replying "they just don't value my talents." He then peeked at this younger brother scribbling in his little journal. "This one will do well though, they love kids that bury themselves in books."

Aram ignored this amateurish taunt. He knew better by now. He quietly captured the world as he saw it in his journal, writing down the stories he could and couldn't see. 

The motorcade left their compound located at the prestigious Outerring, headed on to the Peraxis bridge that leapt for several miles over the Middlering. The bridge was a remarkable achievement, towering over the population as if it passed over an ocean. It saved countless hours of time as people headed towards the central core of Proxacity, the International City of the Cultures.

Aram stopped writing and stared down onto the infinite walls and endless roads that passed beneath. The colors of the roofs blended together into a grayish sludge. Occasionally, he felt he made eye contact with someone for a split second. An old lady who peeped through a hole in the wall or a child who played on the streets? Perhaps. Aram wondered how many people lived in the Middlering and what stories they must hold in themselves.

***

It was apparent they neared Proxacity when the colors changed from dull gray to bright pastels, concrete gave way to stones, and silent attentiveness turned into comfortable relaxation. 

The motorcade snaked its way through the crowded narrow streets that barely separated skyscrapers. The afternoon sun itself would seep through in the thinnest possible sheets of light.

"Are we there yet?" impatiently asked Arcan. Apart turned to the driver, who remained expressionless. "When you see the light again we will be there," replied Apart.

Sure enough, the buildings cleared, and a great circle of green pastures remained nestled in the midst, unto which the sun showered its warmth with selfless grace. On one side were the buildings, forming an arc around the greenery, and and the other side was the seemingly endless water of Oceania.

"Garden of Decisions," wrote Aram in his notebook, "not because any decision are made here, but as it is connected by a beautiful walkway to the Great Hall of Stationary Decisions. Calling it the Garden of the Great Hall of Stationary Decisions would not have been the most eloquent of labels, and hence, it is known as the Garden of Decisions." Aram looked out his window, and noticed the garden was moving. He squinted.

"Look at all those people!" Arcan excitedly got out of his seat and moved on to Aram's side, knocking his journal to the floor. "There must be a billion people, right dad!"

"Math really isn't your strongest subject Arcan. But yes, all those people, soon you won't see any of the grass! The news estimates there will be a few million people here today for the Festival," Apart nodded while pointing towards the snippet of news on his hands.

Aram quietly picked up his journal. A few pages had creased, which led to an unresolvable disappointment within him.

The motorcade stopped and the door was opened by a young woman in uniform. She poked her head inside and smiled at Aram. "Hey I'm Opira. Are you boys ready? Don't let any of this overwhelm you." Opira then glanced towards Apart, "Good afternoon Sir, we'll take you all to the special viewing area for the ceremonies now."

Aram interjected quickly, "can't we go see our Mom before?" 

"Yes, it would be nice if we could," Apart inquired towards Opira.

Opira whispered briefly to someone outside before saying "Sure, we have some time!"

The four of them hopped onto a small motorized cart, that took one of the paths that was cordoned off from the crowds. The closer they get to the center of the Garden of Decisions, the louder it got. At the center of the garden was a grandiose monument to celebrate the Proximity between the two planets, Aique and Sifr. It appears as if two giant mounds kissed each other, one rising from the ground itself and the other mysteriously floating in the air and almost transparent due to its mesh construction.

"This must be the first Proximity for both of you," stated Opira before continuing and pointing towards the monument, "the space between the monuments two slivers of spheres represent the Proximity and make for a giant stage. Station Alma, your Mom, is inside the ground sphere that represents our amazing planet Aique. You'll get to see the inside of the spheres today; in fact very few people on Aique get to experience this!" she said cheerfully while Aram dutifully noted down here explanations.

They entered through a guarded door at the base of the ground sphere and were led through several corridors with guarded entrances before entering this vast hall that lay hidden from the outside. 

Aram noticed that people were dressed impeccably, holding drinks and grabbing appetizers from trays carried by people dressed equally well. Aram's hands instinctively	 went towards his pocket. His tie was still there, but this wasn't the right time to attempt to put it on.

Opira led them to an enclave. "Station Alma, you have some visitors!" she announced with a smile.

Alma turned to Opira and gave her a stern stare, in response to interrupting the seemingly important conversation she was having with a man dressed quite differently from the rest of the guests, but in a way that set him above them without being overbearingly obvious.

"Alma my dear," Apart walked forward to avoid any unnecessary disciplining of the helpful young lady. Alma returned her contorted face to normal, "Ah, Apart, I'm glad you and the kids made it in the time. Let me have a look at them." Arcan and Aram stepped forward in sync besides their father, standing up straight as possible without making eye contact. Alma shook her head, "where are the ties we got for you two?" she said in such a quiet manner it seemed to pierce through the ears of everyone around.

Aram's hand squeezed his right pocket. This was also not the right time.

"Won't you introduce me to your family, Station Alma?" interjected the uniquely dressed man, hoping to avoid an incidence of infanticide in front of a crowd of very well connected people.

_They are led to the staging area where Alma is chatting with Mazar. Aram notices two girls playing nearby. Arcan teases Aram about the girls. Aram tries to ignore him and waits till Alma comes to them. They all wish her good luck. Alma introduces Mazar to the kids and Mazar introduces his family to them. Aram and Mara, meet for the first time. Phea comes up and introduces herself, proclaiming she's the daughter of the Metastation._

***

_Back at the viewing area, Aram's eyes search for Mara in the crowd. He feels her presence and her searching for him. The speeches begin, with the Station of Sifr opening the talks. The Station of Sifr talks about the planetary Proximity between Aique and Sifr, its meaning to them and reminding everyone about the cycle of life._

***

_The Station of Defense, Alma, goes up next and announces the successful deployment of the Sky Mesh, which at the nights viewing will light up the skies. She also announces a new 20 year initiative to send an exploratory rocket. Both of these announcements receive an ovation but a small vocal crowd, the Mystics, protest._

***

_The new Metastation, Pastel, delivers the final speech. He talks about the unifying of all Cultures and having the Sky Mesh be a reminded for all the Cultures to live in peace and harmony; and to protect themselves from a repeat of past conflicts with the Isolates._

***

_With that the festivities begin. There are fireworks and music and dances and performances. Aram is mesmerized by the energy yet he can't stop thinking about Mara. Sifr shines a pearl blue with spots of green, reminded him of her eyes. As night falls green streaks appear in the sky - the Sky Mesh has been turned on._

_Apart takes his kids to their motorcade and as Aram is getting in, he sees Mara in the distance, who gives him a smile as she gets in her own car._
